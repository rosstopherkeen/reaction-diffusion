Hey there, did you take your medicine?

This is going to be a place for me (and you) to try out and view web experiments. From 2D art to 3D art, vanilla CSS to creative coding with Processing.
I think I'll either use this as a log book to put down my thoughts or even run it as a respectable blog one day.

The goal is to post daily, which I think isn't going to be an easy thing given my track record for slowing down on 
projects ([you can ask this guy about that](https://twitter.com/sid_devesh)). Hopefully I stick to this daily or at the very least weekly.
This will also be an outlet for some of the weird rants/debates/discussions I have with other people in my life.

Also, if you find any problems with the site, please [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rosstopherkeen). 
This is the first time I'm building anything on the web and any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Maybe eventually I'll figure out how to use ReactJS and get a nice site running on here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The next few things I'll be working on --
* Deploy to [Render](https://render.com)
* Figure out how to serve images in Gatsby
* Change out theme colours and UI
* Build out a proper landing page

Hopefully the next thing I post won't look the same as this one.
