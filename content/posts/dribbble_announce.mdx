Good news first - [I FINALLY POSTED MY FIRST DRIBBBLE SHOT!](https://dribbble.com/rosstopherkeen)

Now onto the bad news.
I didn't
* post daily on this blog/site
* figure out how to serve images on Gatsby
* change the site's theme
* build a proper landing page

I said I'd do all the things and more around a month ago in the last post, but since then, I haven't really gotten much done
and was feeling pretty bummed out about it. It got to a point where I would procrastinate by either helping out [SiD](https://twitter.com/sid_devesh) with 
some branding for his projects or binge on [Netflix shows](https://www.netflix.com/title/80002479).

But this week I finally got my first dribbble post out and hopefully I'll keep checking off things on my to-do list.

PS: I found out about the [/now movement](https://nownownow.com), might add a /now page here soon.
